**The Project**:construction_worker:

This is our project from week :one: of the Founders and Coders programming bootcamp. The guidelines were to build an agency website containing a navbar, a form and an 'about us' page. 

We decided to build a website for a fictional agency which provides services to Pokemon owners: medical consultations, makeovers, therapy sessions and training :arrow_right:  whatever a Pokemon may need!  

The _Landing Page_ displays Pimp my Poke's logo along with a tagline sentence. You can click the logo to reach the rest of the website. 
The _About_ page gives a little bit of **Pimp my Poke**'s history and explains what services we offer.  
The _Pimperz_ :nail_care: page gives a detailed description of Pimp my Poke employees to show that they all have extensive experience in the Poke pimping field.   
The _Call Me Maybe_ :phone: page lets you get in touch and leave some more details about your pokemon's needs.  

The website was designed mobile-first.

**Known issues**:exclamation:
- Page sizing isn't quite right, possibly due to background image
- On certain page sizes, navigation links are too far to the right and are only partially visible
- Images take quite a while to load

**Coming soon/ To do list** :thought_balloon:
- Hide overflow on pimpz page
- Add form label 'select the service you require' above dropdown input
