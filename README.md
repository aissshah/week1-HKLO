# week1-HKLO

**The Project**:construction_worker:

This is our project from week 1 of the Founders and Coders programming bootcamp. The guidelines were to build an agency website containing a navbar, a form and an 'about us' page. 

We decided to build a website for a fictional agency which provides services to Pokemon owners: medical consultations, makeovers, therapy sessions and training  :arrow_right: whatever a Pokemon may need! 
The _About_ page gives a little bit of **Pimp my Poke**'s history and explains what services we offer. 
The _Pimperz_ :nail_care: page gives a detailed description of Pimp my Poke employees to show that they all have extensive experience in the Poke pimping field. 
The _Call Me Maybe_ :phone: page lets you get in touch and leave some more details about your pokemon's needs.
