                <p>When I lost my Poke to depression at the age of 13, I decided enough was enough and swore to devote my life to tackling Pokemon’s mental health. 
                        <br><br>Having graduated with a dual degree in psychology and neuroscience from the University of Monopok, I went on to write a PhD titled: ‘Pokemon experiences of trauma in early life: social context and influences on psychological outcomes’. I now work full time at Pimp my Poke, making sure Pokemon’s are as beautiful and strong on the inside as on the outside.</p>
